# Theme

The default theme for [Feedback Hub](https://github.com/thakurganeshsinghfw/logchimp).

# Development

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) _(see package.json for required engine)_, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run development server
pnpm dev
```
